# Snake Game (C)

Terminal-based Snake game written in C using the ncurses library.
This project is a work in progress and was built to practice
game loops, real-time input handling, and basic state management in C.

## Current Features
- Real-time keyboard input using ncurses
- Continuous game loop with screen refresh
- Snake movement logic
- Basic game-over detection

## Running
```bash
gcc main.c Snake.c -o snake -lncurses
./snake
